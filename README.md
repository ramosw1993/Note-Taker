# Note Taker

## Project Description

This app is a digital note taker, which saves and deletes notes that were submitted by the cilent.
The app is to link the frontend to the backend server in order to CRUD files, storing all of the saved notes as a JSON format and establishing express pathing.

I had difficulty with the linking of the routers to the html since it is a very new concept to me. However, I am pleased to be able to understand what is going on in the code by reading and working through the code.
